Installation
============
At some point, pet2mri will be avaliable on pip, but as of this writing this is not yet the case. To get
pet2mri, please download the script from the GitHub repo_.
After downloading the script, place it in a directory in your path. Finally, make it executable with
the following command::

	chmod +x pet2mri

Basic Example
=============
Before pet2mri can be used each subject with a PET scan must have a corresponding structural MRI scan
that has been processing with FreeSurfer's recon-all stream. One all structural MRIs have been processed,
you can proceed with processing your PET images.

A typical command will look something like this::

	pet2mri -i PET_SUB0024_20160116.nii.gz -s SUB0024 -r bb

This will register the input Nifti volume (PET_SUB0024_20160116.nii.gz) to the structural scan of subject SUB0024.
using boundary-based registration (see Processing section). As a reminder: before subject SUB0024 can be used with
pet2mri, it must have a structural scan that has been processed with recon-all and the output from that procedure
must be in $SUBJECTS_DIR. The results from pet2mri processing will be stored in::

	$SUBJECTS_DIR/SUB0024/pet/

For additional information on options, you can go to the Processing section on this site. A less verbose explanation
of these options can be viewed with the -h (or --help) flag::

	pet2mri -h

Requirements
============
pet2mri depends on several mmodules and tools. Once pet2mri is available on pip, it will hopefully be
packaged with all of its dependencies. For now, you must download these seperately before using pet2mri:

- Python 2.7 : We plan on adding compatibility for Python 3 in version 2.0 of pet2mri.
- FreeSurfer : This is readilly available at here_.
- Python packages : Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Nibabel.

To get the required packages, we recommend Anaconda_.
