pet2mri is a tool for processing and quantification of PET data. It is essentially a Python
script that acts as a wrapper for various FreeSurfer commands.

The script performs the following steps:

1. Computes registration between input PET volume and a subject's MRI.
2. Applies registration to input PET volume and saves result
3. Generates and saves SUVr image
4. Calculates regional SUVr values
5. Generates screenshots of PET overlaid onto MRI.
